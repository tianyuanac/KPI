## Non-Functional Requirements

The following are potential requirements discussed during the initial meeting:

### 1. Business Model Discovery
- Leverage the client's years of experience to help them achieve their ideal business model.
- The platform will act as a prototype that can be expanded over time to improve scalability and align with market trends.

### 2. Framework Compatibility
- The client's current websites may be built on different frameworks, posing integration challenges.
- Instead of merging the frameworks, it is suggested to create a central platform linking the existing sites while maintaining their independence.

### 3. Content Gathering and Marketing Optimization
- The client will provide example pages, keywords, and descriptions to support SEO and marketing.
- The content should be structured to facilitate marketing campaigns, including Google Ads and LinkedIn Ads.

### 4. Scope of the Platform
- Due to time constraints, the platform will initially consist of links to the client’s existing sites.
- Future expansion (possibly by another student team) could build upon this initial platform to further integrate functionality.

## Future Considerations

- The scope of this project focuses on consolidating the client’s services into a single, easily navigable website with clear marketing goals.
- Future development may involve expanding the platform's features, increasing the level of integration between services, or further enhancing user experience based on user feedback and business goals.
